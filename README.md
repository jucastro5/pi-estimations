# pi-esimations

Estimating pi using two methods:

    Method 1: Randomly plotting points on a 1x1 graph with a Circle of R=1 inscribed. The ratio of points in the circle to total points is directly related to pi
  
    Method 2: Buffon's needle problem method. What is the probibilty of a dropped needle crossing the area where 2 floorboards meet?
    
From wikipedia:

"In mathematics, Buffon's needle problem is a question first posed in the 18th century by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon:

Suppose we have a floor made of parallel strips of wood, each the same width, and we drop a needle onto the floor. What is the probability that the needle will lie across a line between two strips?

Buffon's needle was the earliest problem in geometric probability to be solved; it can be solved using integral geometry. The solution, in the case where the needle length is not greater than the width of the strips, can be used to design a Monte Carlo method for approximating the number Ï€, although that was not the original motivation for de Buffon's question."
